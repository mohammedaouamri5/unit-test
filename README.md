# TP2-TL-AEF

In .\Script\, run the script for your OS and execute it. In theory, it should generate the Makefile needed, but I don't guarantee that all the C/C++ code will compile without errors.

Note : you need to run the script from 
```bash
$ .../Script> 
```

Note: For Windows GCC, you need to add CC=gcc to line 20 in TP.make 


you need to have `fmt` too
